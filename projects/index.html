    <h2>Rainbow Six: Siege Randomizer</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>I developed a randomizer for the first person shooter Ranbow Six:Siege. The program randomly generates
            an operator along with a set of valid loadout. I used an object-oriented approach in the design process for the ease
            of making future changes in case of new patchs. 
        </p>
        <p>This was also my very first experience of integrating backend logics with fronend elements. I am excided to improve the
            visual effect of the page and add new functionalities with knowledge from this class!

    <h2>Spam Email Detector</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>In the summer of 2023, I developed a spam email detector via prompt engineering with OpenAI's 
            GPT-3.5 and GPT-3.5-turbo models. During this process, I formulated and fine-tuned GPT prompts, with the goal of
            generating precise one-word prediction to classify incoming emails into either spam or non-spam groups.</p>
        <p>I continuously evaluated model performance and optimized the prompts along the way, ensuring consistent improvement in the
        detector's accuracy and efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Customer Support Chatbot</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>In early 2023, I developed a customer support chatbot using articles available from the Stripe company website. 
            This project utilized OpenAI's "text-embedding-ada-002" model for embedding analysis to ensure deep understanding of user
            queries, and integrated cosine similarity analysis for matching user queries to the most relevant information.
        </p>
        <p>Prompt engineering techniques were also employed to continuously improve response quality.</p>
        <p>Sample prompt: </p>

    <h2>Senior Thesis</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>For my undergraduate senior thesis project, I joined Prof. Jae Hur's lab to research an obesity-related gene for its impact on lipid metabolism. 
            The lab focused utilized <em>Drosophila Melanogaster</em> (fruit flies) as the model organism. </p>
        <p>In this process, I managed transgenic fruit fly populations with genetic knockdowns and conducted DNA isolation and RT-qPCR, and 
            utilized spectrophotometry to quantify triglyceride and protein levels, with data analysis in R and Excel.</p>
